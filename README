Project Description:
	This is really an exercise in learning Ruby (otherwise, Ruby would not 
	have been picked, as it's not well suited to this kind of application).
	Apart from that, it's goal is to use a genetic algorithm to create
	series of keypresses that beat QWOP (http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html).

Status:
	Can get 4-5 metres consistently after 5-10 generations, then peters out
	due to lack of consistency.
 
Dependencies:
	>=ruby1.9.1
	xdotool
	xwd
	convert
	gocr
	xlib-devel (for making grabpixel)
	google-chrome
	1440x900 resolution (ridiculous)

To run:
	cd qwopper
	make
	ruby1.9.1 qwop.rb

Notes:
	Theoretically, xlib makes it possible to run this in the background,
	but most programs (Chrome included) ignore sent keypresses
	unless they're running in the foreground.  (See "man xdotool")

TODO:
	Make breeding function work so distance goes beyond ~5 meters
	Make resolution independent 
	Improve consistency
