Dependencies:
	>=ruby1.9.1
	xdotool
	xwd
	convert
	gocr
	xlib-devel (for making grabpixel)
	google-chrome
	1440x900 resolution

To run:
	cd qwopper
	make
	ruby1.9.1 qwop.rb

Notes:
	Theoretically, xlib makes it possible to run this in the background,
	but in reality, most programs (Chrome included) ignore the keypresses
	send unless they're in the foreground.  (See "man xdotool")

TODO:
	Make breeding function work so distance goes beyond ~5 meters
	Make resolution independent
